This PCB is designed to work with the Serial Wombat 18AB chip's Cap Touch pin mode.   This PCB provides 9 touch pads which can be connected to the Serial Wombat 18AB chip's analog capable pins.  

See the following for a tutorial on using the Cap Touch pin mode.  Pads on this PCB function essentially the same as a coin covered with tape connected to a wire.  For best results, calibrate each pad as shown in the video after completing your circuit.
